# Welcome to the Citadel Game, the best RPG role-play ever!
The goal of the game is to build up your kingdom to get most points as possible and 
to hinder your opponents to develop his!

**Game's flow** : 
## Each player choose a character among the list below for one round.
If one character is chosen, it cannot be chosen anymore.
- Assassin - Thief - Wizard - King - Merchant - Architect - Priest - Captain
Each one has it's own power, you will discover next.
The order of playing is always the same : Assassin is always first, Thief always second, Captain's always last etc ... 

## You can do these 3 actions during your turn (but it's not mandatory you can do one, two or all these actions):
- Collect +2 money or draw 2 cards and pick one among those
- Build a district of your choice and pay it's price
- Use the power of your character
The order of the actions doesn't matter.

## Once all characters have played, the round is over and a new pick-up character phase begun.
(Of course money, deck and kingdom of each player remains. But if the character wad dead or raidable, 
he is not anymore)

**Rules**
## There are 5 colors: green (merchant), red (captain), yellow (king), blue (priest) et purple (wonder).
Each building has a price, a color (corresponding to a character). 
When it's the character turn, he gains +1 money for each building with the same color as his (all characters 
don't have necesarily a color, in that case they are just white) automatically.

## End game conditions: when a player has 5 (or 7 according to the number of players) district in kingdom
# Then we count points.
